**WARNING**

Still in development. Read the README carefully.


TODO
----

Current development version have some limitations
which should be fixed in first release:

* [\[issue #16\]](https://github.com/braiden-vasco/lita-tox/issues/16)
  **libtoxcore** is not included in the gem. It should be compiled manually
  to build the gem native extension successfully. Follow the instructions in
  [that file](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/2ab3b14731061cc04d3ccc50a35093c11d018298/INSTALL.md)

* [\[issue #17\]](https://github.com/braiden-vasco/lita-tox/issues/17)
  JRuby is not supported. Only C extension for Tox is implemented

* [\[issue #18\]](https://github.com/braiden-vasco/lita-tox/issues/18)
  Message length is limited to value of `TOX_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`
  (see [source code of **libtoxcore**](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/2ab3b14731061cc04d3ccc50a35093c11d018298/toxcore/tox.h#L252-L255))

* Adapter has incomplete API for Lita. Only basic methods are implemented


Usage
-----

At first, see the documentation for Lita: http://docs.lita.io/

### Installation

**libtoxcore** should be compiled manually at your computer or server.
Follow the instructions in
[that file](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/2ab3b14731061cc04d3ccc50a35093c11d018298/INSTALL.md)

When **libtoxcore** is installed, add **lita-tox**
to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lita-tox', '~> 0.3.0'
```

### Configuration

`config.robot.name` will be used as Tox user name

Mentions in Tox usually use user name, Tox clients usually allow mentioning
by writing first letters of user name and pressing `<Tab>`, so don't use
`config.robot.mention_name`

#### Optional attributes

- `savedata_filename` (String) - Path to file where Tox state will be stored (if provided)
- `status` (String) - Tox user status

#### Example

This is an example `lita_config.rb` file:

```ruby
Lita.configure do |config|
  config.robot.name = 'Lita chat bot'

  config.robot.adapter = :tox

  config.adapters.tox.savedata_filename = 'savedata'
  config.adapters.tox.status = "Send me \"#{config.robot.name}: help\""
end
```
